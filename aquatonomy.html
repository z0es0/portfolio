        <p class="section-description">The final design solution is a fully prototyped and tested mobile app that empowers individuals with substance use disorder to easily find nearby resources, such as syringes, social services, and treatment options. Designed to uplift the community, Season enables users to share real-time information on supply availability, wait times, and reviews of facilities they’ve visited. </p>

            <p>Season provides a comprehensive directory connecting individuals with harm reduction, treatment, and other essential services in their region. App users can search for specific needs—like access to syringes—or explore nearby resources such as housing support, counseling, and education.</p>

Extensive desk research enabled us to grasp the nuances of substance use and harm reduction, giving us a shared language with which to have meaningful conversations with user testers. Continuous collaboration with our client, combined with insightful user testing, enabled us to develop an app that aims to support people who use drugs, fostering community and agency through the sharing of knowledge.</p>
